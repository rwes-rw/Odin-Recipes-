    <strong><p>This is a fun Halloween sweet treat that is easy enough for

     expensive and easier to put together.</p></strong>

    <h3>Steps To Creating Cookies From the Void</h3>
    <P>The magic starts here!</P>
    <ol>

            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Line baking sheets with baking parchment.</li>
        <P></P>
            <li>Beat shortening, peanut butter, brown sugar, and 
                1/2 cup white sugar together with an electric mixer 
                in a large bowl until smooth. Beat egg into the creamy 
                mixture until fully incorporated. Stir milk and vanilla 
                extract into the mixture until smooth.</li>
        <p></p>
            <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a small 
                bowl; add to the wet mixture in the large bowl and 
                stir until completely incorporated into a dough. Divide 
                and shape dough into 48 balls.</li>
        <p></p>
            <li>Spread 1/4 cup white sugar into a wide, shallow bowl. 
                Roll dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange about 2 
                inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <P></P>   
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 
                minutes. Remove cookies from oven and quickly press 
                a dimple into the middle of each cookie using the blunt 
                end of a wooden spoon. Cool cookies on sheets for 10 
                minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack to 
                cool completely.</li>
         <P></P>
            <li>Cut each chocolate sphere into two hemispheres. 
                    Put one piece atop each cookie with the rounded 
                    side facing upwards. </li>
        <p></p>
             <li>Spoon frosting into a pastry bag with a small round 
                 tip or a plastic freezer bag with one end snipped off. 
                Dab a small amount of frosting onto the back of each candy 
                eyeball and stick two onto each chocolate candy to resemble
                eyes. Then pipe frosting in four thin lines, starting at 
                the base of the candy, on each side atop the cookie to 
                resemble spider legs.</li>
        <p></p>
            <li>Let frosting harden at room temperature, about 30 minutes. 
                Store cookies in an airtight container.</li>
